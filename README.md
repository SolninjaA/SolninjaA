# Who am I?
Hi, I'm Solomon! I highly value privacy, security and user-focused design. This has led me to create my home-lab and self-host various services. Because of this, I have gained familiarity with tools which are used in production environments as well.

Some other facts about me:
- ðŸ¥‹ I am a 1st-dan black belt in Taekwon-do.
- ðŸŽŒ I am currently studying Japanese.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://github.com/SolninjaA/Chhoto-URL-Extension
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
